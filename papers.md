We're opening a total of **5 speaker slots**. Talks are 30 minutes long, including Q&A.

Rust is a new language so all papers are welcome. If you have been working on something for only 6 months, but it's interesting, then apply!


## Ideas

Check out this [Rust Community Talks repository](https://github.com/rust-community/talks) for inspiration.  Aside from looking at what other people have requested, here are some ideas:

- What's new or coming up in the latest version of Rust (similar to http://this-week-in-rust.org/ )
- How to contribute to Rust community
- Demonstrate your/someone else's rust library X to solve problem Y
- Anything Cargo (tips, tricks, integration with other builds)
- The history of Rust (e.g. scrapped features, motivations, pivotal RFCs)
- Rust FFI/how to integrate with common C libraries
- Rust usage in a popular project (e.g. Servo, Piston, etc), or a project of your own (no matter how trivial!)
- Rust for gamedev/real-time/embedded systems
- How Rust and LLVM work together or how other bits of the Rust compiler work
- Embedding other languages in Rust, or embedding Rust in other languages
- Testing, benchmarking, profiling, debugging, REPL, IDE, editor experiences/tips/tricks/tools
- War stories solving bugs, compilation errors, or production experiences
