## Tickets: first batch gone, next will come soon

It didn't take long before our first batch of tickets, the largest batch we had, was sold out. But not to worry. Keeping up with our promise to give everyone equal chance, this one is for the weekday early birds. The next batch of tickets will go on sale

The next batch after will start during the weekend and the last batch will go on sale September 1st. If you don't want to wait until then, there are still some Combo Tickets and Supporter tickets available at the moment.
