On Saturday your ticket includes breakfast snacks, lunch, cake and dinner. Coffee and cold drinks will be served for free throughout the day. For the evening we invite you for drinks and (pay-your-own) beers in the Microsoft Eatery in front of the Conference Venue â€“ and yes, the XBox's will be available for playing, too.

_Note_: If you are in Berlin and just want to meet the community during the Saturday evening event, Tickets for that will be available very soon!

# Sunday

Starting we invite you to join us once again for coffee and a breakfast snack (from 9:30) to the Atrium for a keynote to kick off the day. Before flocking off to the workshop rooms or stay at the Atrium to meet other community members. Finally, we'll close the event at the Atrium with the closing keynote at 5pm.
