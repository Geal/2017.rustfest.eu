On Saturday your ticket includes breakfast snacks, lunch, cake and dinner. Coffee and cold drinks will be served for free throughout the day. For the evening we invite you for drinks and (pay-your-own) beers in the Microsoft Eatery in front of the Conference Venue â€“ and yes, the XBox's will be available for playing, too.

_Note_: If you are in Berlin and just want to meet the community during the Saturday evening event, Tickets for that will be available very soon!

# Sunday

Starting at 10:00 and going until 17:30, Sunday features keynotes to start and end the day as well as workshops start!
