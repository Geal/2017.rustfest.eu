Hi everyone, we're happy to announce - with a day of delay - that our CFP is now open.

Please head to [cfp.rustfest.eu](https://cfp.rustfest.eu) for your submission.

There's two particular things about the CFP:

## The Guide

Please read [the guide](https://cfp.rustfest.eu/guide). In our experience, many people with poor proposals haven't. Also, it makes clear who should apply (everyone!) and what the benefits are.

## Mentorship

Following [eurucamp](http://eurucamp.org) and [RubyConf Australias](http://www.rubyconf.org.au/2016) example, we have want every speaker to have a mentor helping them in finalising their talk. This is done through our [unconditional mentorship program](https://cfp.rustfest.eu/mentorship).

If you are interested in helping out as a mentor, sign up on  [cfp.rustfest.eu](https://cfp.rustfest.eu) and tick "I am willing to be a mentor" in the profile section.

## Submit early, submit often!

Finally, start submitting early if you want to receive feedback. Also, this clears your head to coming up with other things.
