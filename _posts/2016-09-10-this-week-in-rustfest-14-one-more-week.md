## Our Master of Ceremonies!

We're very pleased to announce the fantastic Ryan Levick as our Master of Ceremonies! He wrote us a little biography which we're very happy to share with you:

> I’m fairly new to low level programming so it’s been a real joy learning about topics that once seemed to be reserved for those who were fluent in C or C++. I hope to shed some of my excitement on others. This stuff doesn’t need to be scary! I take a lot of my inspiration from [intermezzOS](http://intermezzos.github.io/book/) and the [kaleidoscope](http://llvm.org/docs/tutorial/index.html) LLVM tutorials both of which I think are very approachable.
