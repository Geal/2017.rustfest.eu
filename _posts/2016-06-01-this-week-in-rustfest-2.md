Hello Rustaceans. Here's our weekly update of what happens at Rustfest!

First of all, we finally opened our [Call for Papers](https://cfp.rustfest.eu) last week. Take special note that we have an [extensive guide](https://cfp.rustfest.eu/guide) and a [mentorship programme](https://cfp.rustfest.eu/mentorship). Please [write to us](info@rustfest.eu) if you have any questions or suggestions.

We finally have our [sponsoring info](http://www.rustfest.eu/sponsoring/) online, you can [read about the packages here](http://www.rustfest.eu/assets/downloads/rustfest_2016_sponsorship.pdf).

We also have our first sponsor to announce: [https://1aim.com/](1aim.com) is our first Gold sponsor!

We made our rounds to find an initial set of speakers and will announce soon!

# How you can help

Currently, you can help us by propagating the CFP announcement to as many people as possibly, especially to outreach groups, if you have context to any. We'd be happy to have as many people submit as possible!
