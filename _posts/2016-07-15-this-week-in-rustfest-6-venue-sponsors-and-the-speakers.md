Oh, what a great week for RustFest!

## Venue, in the center of Berlin

Earlier this week really great news arrived: **our most anticipated venue confirmed they will host RustFest 2016!**

At Unter den Linden 17, just steps from to the Brandenburg Gate, **Microsoft Berlin** entertains an amazing conference and event venue in an iconic corner building:

We got the pleasure to visit the "Atrium", their newly equipped conference setting, a few weeks ago and directly knew: this is where we want to host RustFest. I mean, just look at it. And that picture doesn't even cover all the amazing space we're gonna have. Check out [their website to get some impressions](https://www.microsoft-berlin.de/de-de/berlin/).

But wait, there's more. Microsoft Berlin was so impressed with RustFest and what we are up to, they decided to sponsor the event. WHAAA? Yes, Microsoft Berlin let us use the venue _for both days_ free of charge! Our dreams come true.

You know what that means? Well, for once, **WE WILL HAVE WORKSHOPS**. With the venue being sponsored by awesome Microsoft, we have at least one awesome workshop room right on side. Further more we will convert the big room we have for talks on the first day to a big meet-n-greet-n-hack area during the second. So for everyone, who's just happy to finally meet other community members in person and just want to hang out and chat, we'll have space for that, too. Oh, my. This is shaping up to be quite awesome!


## More sponsors

Aside from [Microsoft Berlin](https://www.microsoft-berlin.de/de-de/berlin/), two other organisations decided to join the list of sponsors of RustFest this week. The always awesome [Mozilla](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/) and [QiTASC](http://www.qitasc.at/), a Quality Assurance Provider for mobile from Vienna, decided to join the ranks. The website has been updated accordingly.

Welcome aboard, and thank you very much!


## First CfP speakers confirmed

As promised last week already, we've also selected the first few speaker from the CfP and informed them about our decision. And we are very happy to hear back from so many already, that they can indeed make it. We'll share the first few names and talk descriptions starting next week, but I can already tell you that you'll see some familiar faces as well as complete newcomers to public speaking with topics ranging from hardware, testing over concurrency and disassemblers all the way to community, learning and empathy. We are very happy with the set of talks and can't wait to inform you about them.

Note: if you haven't heard from us yet, that's because we haven't made up our minds fully yet. You'll hear from us within the next few days for sure.
