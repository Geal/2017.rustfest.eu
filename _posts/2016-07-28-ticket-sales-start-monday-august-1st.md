Regular tickets will be **125€** (148,75€ incl. VAT), supporter tickets are priced at 250€. Until August 12th you can get the View Source combo ticket for 350€, which will be 450€ after that. A student discount of 20% will be available on regular tickets.

We will distribute regular tickets in batches, opening at varying times of day giving an appropriate notice beforehand. So, you if don't get any this time, another batch will come.
