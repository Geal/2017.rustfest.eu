No question, it has been a while since we updated you. But as anyone who's ever organised a conference can tell you: most stuff in the beginning happens in the background and can't be announced yet. And RustFest isn't any different: of course we have been busy, of course a lot changed, but nothing we can announce yet â€“ until this week.

## Extending the CfP

We've gotten a good amount of papers in already and are very excited to go through the selection process. Non-the-less we had been asked by a significant number of people whether we could extend the [Call for Papers](https://cfp.rustfest.eu) as they weren't able to submit yet. So, we will be accepting further papers submitted **until June 27th**.

As before, if you have questions or want input on or help with your proposal, **let us help you**: You can send an email to <team@rustfest.eu> or send us a [direct message via twitter](https://twitter.com/rustfest) (DM's are open to the public).

## Announcing Speakers

Even though we are extending the Call for Papers, there are already two speaker we are very excited to have on board:
