As things get ramping up for ViewSource, and more importantly (for us!) RustFest we're happy to say we've had a busy, productive week!

## RustBridge

As some of you may have noticed the [RustBridge signup post](http://discourse.opentechschool.org/t/rustbridge-workshop-sept-18th-berlin-together-with-rustfest/1849) both had a broken poll... and that was unclear about whether you needed a ticket to RustFest to join us.

Well, **you don't**! You just need to sign up for the workshop! We're looking forward to seeing you there, it'll be grand.

## Activities

Conferences are made alive by the people who attend them, and as a community conference we want to ensure our attendees have an opportunity to plan their own activities and invite others.

So this week we set up an instance of the Eurucamp Activities scheduler on Heroku! It's already under a [Heroku domain here](https://rustfest-activities.herokuapp.com/). It will live at [https://activities.rustfest.eu](https://activities.rustfest.eu) as soon as we get an SSL certificate.

Our lovely friends at Heroku offered to let us play in one of their labs so we're going to be doing and experiment with them around SSL certificates! So cool! Sorry for the wait, though! Experiments are fun, but take time. We expect this SSL certificate to be working by Wednesday.

So please, feel welcome to start posting and planning events! They don't need to be Rust related, and psst... You don't even need a ticket!

## Thank You Factor10!

We have so many amazing sponsors, and Factor10 is no different!

Thank you Factor10 for your support of this community event!

## Schedule In Progress

This week we drafted up a schedule for all of our [super speakers](/talks/) and we're now reaching out to them to ensure that everything sounds great to them.

Getting to go over the CFP applications one more time made me both excited and sad again! We had so many great applications and so little time to fill! Hopefully next year we'll get to say "Yes!!!" more!

What we can tell you is the rough start/end times of each day, as well as the fact that there will be time to get tea, coffee, and snacks at least twice without missing anything.

TODO: What is "Bounding box schedule?"
