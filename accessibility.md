Please register our [newsletter](https://ti.to/rust-community-europe/rustfest-2016) for ongoing accessibility information.

RustFest is an inclusive conference and as such strives to be accessible to everyone. This includes:

* Ensuring our venues are accessible by wheelchair.
* Make sure that maps and orientation material is available.
* Providing quiet spaces for those with sensory issues.
* Providing accessibility for conference sessions.
* Providing complimentary tickets for assistants for those with disabilities.
* Access to non-gendered toilets
* Serving a wide range of food

If you're not sure whether the concession rate should apply to you, please do get in touch.

Our goal is that the conference and workshops and all other related events are accessible to people with physical disabilities. However, we are aware that accessibility issues are diverse and we may not have everything covered off in our plans - please reach out, and we will do our very best to confirm we have those requirements under control. Send a mail to [team@rustfest.eu](mailto:team@rustfest.eu)

We will happily reserve you a ticket if it's not immediately clear whether necessary assistance is provided or you have additional planning to do for your trip to RustFest.
